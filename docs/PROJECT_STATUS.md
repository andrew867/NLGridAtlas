# NL Grid Atlas project status

Updated: 2026-11-11

## Repository and hosting

- GitHub repository: `andrew867/NLGridAtlas`.
- Repository visibility: public.
- Default branch: `main`.
- The local `main` branch tracks `origin/main`.
- A GitHub Pages workflow builds with Node.js 20, runs the complete test suite, builds the Vite site, and deploys the `dist` artifact.
- GitHub Pages is live at `https://andrew867.github.io/NLGridAtlas/`.
- GitHub Actions run `43049501960` passed the complete test, build, and deployment workflow for commit `e2194ac`.
- The published build passed desktop and 390 by 844 px browser checks. Its assets loaded under `/NLGridAtlas/`, the MUN-08 detail interaction worked, and the browser reported no warnings or errors.

## Verified in the current work session

- Added the 1975 Memorial University Health Sciences Centre transformer and emergency-generation records.
- Linked MUN-01 and MUN-08 to the Health Sciences electrical-plant evidence panel.
- Kept the six MUN archive photographs as external records because the archive reserves reproduction rights.
- Passed 87 automated tests, source-hash verification, and the production build.
- Verified the Memorial diagram and evidence interaction in the browser.
- Published and verified the atlas on GitHub Pages.
- Added a clickable, source-cited St. John's Main logical one-line for the 2015 selected arrangement.
- Added a clickable Stamp's Lane logical one-line that separates the documented 4.16 kV and 12.5 kV banks.
- Verified the Stamp's Lane diagram at 1440 by 1000 px and 390 by 844 px with no page overflow, out-of-bounds SVG text, browser warnings, or browser errors.
- Linked documented circuit ends to the available detailed diagram, station record, or island terminal record.
- Qualified public commit `af61cb5` from a fresh clone: 71 tests, production build, 66 pinned PDF hashes, and a clean worktree passed.
- Added the interactive 2018 island AC backbone with all 58 filed Hydro circuit designations and 68 filed route segments.
- Added voltage filters, circuit records, station connection records, and links to the existing terminal records.
- Verified one detail panel, circuit and station selection, filtering, zero browser warnings or errors, and a 390 px layout with no page overflow.
- Replaced the ten island terminal summary cards with dated connection diagrams and equipment records.
- Added the filed Sunnyside T1 breaker arrangement, Stony Brook transformer ratings, Buchans T1 replacement rating, Deer Lake transformation ratings, Bottom Brook and Stephenville post-retirement planning arrangement, Massey Drive transformer assignments, and all four Come By Chance capacitor banks.
- Added individual records for Upper Salmon, Granite Canal, Cat Arm, and Hinds Lake with filed plant ratings, energy capability, and documented transmission connections.
- Corrected the 2013 island plant-assignment source reference from physical PDF p. 663 to physical PDF p. 80. Physical PDF p. 663 remains the Holyrood demolition drawing.
- Verified Upper Salmon and Cat Arm record rendering at 1440 by 1000 px and 390 by 844 px. The mobile page has no horizontal page overflow; the one-line remains horizontally scrollable inside its own frame.
- Added a dedicated Molloy's Lane record with 15L and 19L supplies, both transformer records, eight 12.5 kV feeders, the 2023 proposed modernization scope, and six filed feeder route sheets.
- Verified the Molloy's Lane diagram and MOL-01 route sheet at 1440 by 1000 px and 390 by 844 px. The mobile page has no horizontal page overflow; the one-line remains horizontally scrollable inside its frame.
- Added individual west-coast, Northern Peninsula, and rural records for Berry Hill, Peter's Barren, Plum Point, Bear Cove, St. Anthony Airport, Hawke's Bay, Howley, South Brook, Doyles, Grandy Brook, and English Harbour West.
- Verified Berry Hill map selection, station navigation, and record rendering at 1440 by 1000 px and 390 by 844 px. The map selection stayed in place; the record link opened the station register; the mobile page had no horizontal page overflow.

## Active work

1. Add western and rural terminal-station coverage, `ISL-005`.
2. Resolve remaining Avalon feeder-to-transformer and bus-section assignments, `AVL-002`.
3. Complete island transformer nameplate and age records, `ISL-006`.

## Island backbone progress

The structured and interactive 2018 layer contains all 58 Hydro circuit designations in PUB-NP-084 Attachment A, physical PDF pp. 24 to 26: 16 at 66 kV, 16 at 138 kV, and 26 at 230 kV. Every filed segment is rendered with a stable endpoint identifier and source-page detail. Current 69 kV circuit assignments remain open because the 2023 asset report gives only the class total, not circuit designations.

## Remaining Avalon evidence target

The detailed-station pass is complete for the public evidence located to date. Remaining work is not another register-based drawing. It requires protection or operating one-lines that assign feeders to transformer banks and bus sections, especially at Hardwoods, Glendale, Ridge Road, and Stamp's Lane.

Direct circuit navigation is complete where the opposite endpoint has a detailed diagram or station record. TL208 remains labelled to Long Harbour without a destination record.

## Open release gates

- The public evidence-package strategy is not complete.
